# Megic Match Game 

A Megic Match Game I created for the sake of practicing React and Redux toolkit . It features design 
patterns recommended by the documentation. 

It is a work in progress. Any tips on how to better write the code, manage the folder structure, etc would be really appreciated. <br />

The future of this project: <br />

* level one you should choice 2 cards the same . 
* level two you should choice 3 cards the same .
