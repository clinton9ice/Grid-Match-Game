# Megic Match Game 

A Megic Match Game I created for the sake of practicing React and Redux toolkit . It features design 
patterns recommended by the documentation. 

It is a work in progress. Any tips on how to better write the code, manage the folder structure, etc would be really appreciated. <br />
